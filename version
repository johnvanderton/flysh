= 'Base' (Hotfix version v0.1.8), Spring release 2022 = 
=======================================================

## Preamble

    This version is reinforced by a 'hotfix' release which improves the project compatibility with other platforms including 'NPM'. Few new fixes have been added as well, please read the below sections for more information.

## Hotfix version 0.1.8

    - Updating the 'src/index.ts' modules export to include the 'PageRecords' class
    - Updating default "timeout" to 1100ms from 'DEFAULT_INSTANCE_TIMEOUT_VALUE' constant value ('src/InputMessage.ts')
    - Updating tests suite following timeout previous changes
    - Minor changes

## Feature(s)

    - Supports simple parsing from 'HTML' pagination table
    - Supports fields filtering by regular expression
    - The core is now able to override internal 'JQuery' logic
    - The 'SPC' class 'timeout' parameter becomes optional with a default value set to 1100ms

## Limitation(s)
    
        - Undefined fields means that no sibling was presetted, the returned results will be like,
            Map(1) { undefined => 'value' }, ...

        - An 'SPC' class instance defined with a full filter selector without any sibling is only returning a raw result,
            
            ''' Typescript code example
                let inputMessage = new InputMessage('.','/test/dataset/000.htm',true);
                inputMessage.addSPC('table tr td');
                let f = new Flysh(inputMessage);
                f.run()
                    .then(() => {
                        console.log(f.getOutputMessage());
                    );

            ''' 'HTML' type document sample code
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>row_0_col_0_value</td>
                        <td>row_0_col_1_value</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>row_1_col_0_value</td>
                        <td>row_1_col_1_value</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

            ''' Results
                    { undefined => 'row_0_column_0_value' },
                    { undefined => 'row_0_column_1_value' },
                    { undefined => 'row_1_column_0_value' },
                    { undefined => 'row_1_column_1_value' }

        - In case of pagination table ('navpane') parsing, if the 'href' tag property doesn't have a full 'protocol/domain/pathto/page' the next exception might occur,

                Cause : Invalid URL: '/path/to'
                    at some code line 123
                errorID: '1500003100'
